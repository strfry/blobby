MULTI-THREAD primary:
 * extensive network checks
 * fix all replay related stuff [we might have to break compatibiltiy]

MULTI-THREAD secondary:
 * add lag compensation to network [this is now an easy bonus, so go for it]
 * remove threading related lag
 * frame interpolation
 
MULTI-THREAD tertiary:
 * fix blood gfx effects
 * allow multiple game speeds on the server
 * remove singleton SpeedController
 * delag events [e.g. whistle] in a safe manner, i.e. prevent skipping/doubling events 
 
MULTI-THREAD BUGS:
 * the blobby animation [speed] is not sent over network, and thus can cause jittering
 * once a impact sound was not played
