MULTI-THREAD primary:
 * extensive network checks
 * move game speed controller into duelmatch/game logic/clock
 * review thread safety of DuelMatch functions (e.g. currently, getClock is unsafe)
 * check that server still works as expected
 * fix network and gfx fps to 60
 * rework NetworkGameState
 
 MULTI-THREAD secondary:
 * fix all replay related stuff [we might have to break compatibiltiy]
 * replay recording in DuelMatch
 * fix blood gfx effects
 * add lag compensation to network [this is now an easy bonus, so go for it]
 * delag events [e.g. whistle] in a safe manner, i.e. prevent skipping/doubling events 
 * allow multiple game speeds on the server
 * remove singleton SpeedController
